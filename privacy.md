# Privacy Policy

Renevision ("us", "we", or "our") operates the website and the XCMania mobile application (the "Service").

Solocat Studio built the XCMania app as a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by Solocat Studio and is intended for use as is.

If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection And Use

For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained on your device and is not collected by us in any way.
Log Data
We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the app we collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

## Types of Data Collected

No personal data is collected.

Location information is collected, together with other sensor data, such as compass, pressure, and accelerometer data.
We do not use any cookies or any similar tracking technologies.
When using third party services to upload your log, or to perform life tracking during flight, the app may use and store login credentials for those third party services. These credentials are securely stored in the app in order to make future use of the services as seamless as possible.

## Use of Data

The XCMania app uses the collected data solely in order to provide the service to you, and to provide you with the IGC log after a flight. The data is never exported outside the app, unless you explicitly take action yourself to enable that. The following data is collected.
Location information is stored in the IGC log which is kept inside the app.

## Transfer Of Data

Your data is never transfered outside the app without explicit action by you.
When explicitly enacted by you, the IGC log is uploaded to a flight server such as XContest, shared with other apps, or shared in other ways that you choose.
The app uses the 3rd party service to show your location on the map. This may provide 3rd party with your approximate location associated with your IP address.

## Disclosure Of Data

Legal Requirements
Renevision may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:
- To comply with a legal obligation
- To protect and defend the rights or property of Renevision
- To prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- To protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public
- To protect against legal liability

## Security Of Data

The security of your data is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Service Providers

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
Sharing with Other Sites

The app allows your data to be provided to sites / companies that are not operated by us, after your explicit request and consent. If you make use of those services, your data will be provided to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you use.
