# Free and Paid Services

## Free and Paid Services

A description of our Services, together with an explanation of which Services and their features are available only for app Users. Some of our Services are provided to you free of charge. The Services that do not require payment are referred to as a “Free Service”, and the Services that require payment before you can access them are referred to as a “Paid Service”.

We may also periodically offer third-party products and services in conjunction with or through our Services (such as Maps). We are not responsible for any products and services provided by such third parties.

We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered services, plans and fees at any time in accordance with these Terms of Use.

## Subscriptions, price changes

You may purchase a Paid Service through a third party by paying an in-advance monthly subscription fee or some other recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase (“Subscription”). If you purchase a Paid Service through a third party, you acknowledge that separate terms with such third party, in addition to the Agreements, may apply. The specific mode of payment and the period for which the Paid Service is subscribed may vary depending on the respective Paid Service. If you purchase a Subscription, you authorize XCMania to charge you automatically each month, year or other respective recurring interval until you cancel.

XCMania may change the prices for the Paid Services from time to time. For existing users of the given Paid Services, the price changes will take effect at the start of the next period of the Subscription following the date of the price change. You accept the new price by continuing to use the respective Paid Service after the price change takes effect. In the case of price changes for Subscriptions, XCMania will, on its own behalf or through the respective third party through which you purchased the Subscription, notify you in advance of any price changes and, if applicable, instruct you on how to accept these changes. If you do not agree to the price changes or take the prescribed action, your Subscription will expire at the end of its current recurring period and will not automatically renew.

## Right of withdrawal for consumers

The following provisions of this Article 4.3 only apply to those Users who are consumers in terms of the applicable legislation for the protection of consumers and the extent to which the right of withdrawal from the given Paid Service is granted to them under such legislation.

If you register for a Subscription, you may change your mind for any or no reason and withdraw from the relevant Paid Service within free trial days from the day you sign up for the Subscription (the “Withdrawal Period”).

By signing up for a Subscription, you explicitly request us to start providing the respective Paid Service to you immediately and, therefore, before the end of the respective Withdrawal Period.

You may withdraw from the Subscription by cancelling it through the third party through which you signed up for the Subscription, according to their terms of service, or, if the cancellation through such third party is not possible, by contacting the Provider at info@XCMania.com.

If you withdraw from a Subscription within the Withdrawal Period, we will refund you any prepaid Fees for the remainder of the relevant Subscription calculated from the moment of such withdrawal.

## Renewal, Cancellation

Your payment schedule with the third party through which you purchased the Paid Service will automatically renew at the end of the applicable subscription period, unless you cancel your Subscription before the end of the then-current subscription period. If you purchased the Subscription through a third party, you may cancel the Subscription through such third party according to their terms of service. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current Subscription period.

If you cancel your payment or Paid Service and/or terminate any of the Agreements before the end of your current Subscription period, we will not refund any fees already paid to us.
